## Individual Weekly Points
Each week, individuals will earn points by completing activity minutes. Any activity counts. For the first 210 minutes completed in a week (equal to 30 minutes/day), individuals will earn a point for every minute of activity. For each minute beyond 210, individuals will earn progressively less points per minute (diminishing returns on a logarithmic scale). This is to prevent individual members in a section from dominating the section's score, and make everyone else's contributions more meaningful. Every week, individual points will reset.

## Section Weekly Scoring
Every week, sections will get a score based on the average of their members' points for the week. This average will ensure that larger sections won't have an advantage over smaller sections. It should also be noted that this average will be taken over ALL members currently accepted in the section, not just the participating ones. This means that nonparticipating members will be treated as zeros in the section's average. This is by design, and intended to act as incentive for everyone to participate. Each week, the sections will be ranked based on their averages. The top scoring section will be award 12 points, the next 11, etc., all the way down to the lowest section, which will be awarded 1 point for the week. Since each week individual points reset, sections will always have an equal opportunity to win the week. This will hopefully keep things competitive through to the end. 

## Final Scoring
In the end, sections will be ranked based on their cumulative scores across the weeks, and the section with the highest score will win. To win this challenge, sections must be consistent in participation across all weeks.

## Rule Modifications
While we will do our best to keep things consistent, we reserve the right to modify these rules as needed to keep things fair and fun for everyone. Any modifications to the rules will be communicated via the weekly email.
